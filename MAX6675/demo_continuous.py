Temperature Monitoring using MAX6675 with ESP32  
Author: Er-Rajas  
Description:  
  This script continuously reads temperature from the MAX6675 thermocouple sensor  
  and prints the values over serial. Designed for MicroPython on ESP32.  

  Adjust the delay on line 24 as needed: `time.sleep([desired_delay])`
